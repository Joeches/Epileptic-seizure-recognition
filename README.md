# Epileptic-seizure-recognition
"Developed a predictive model for epileptic seizure detection using machine learning techniques. Achieved high accuracy with SVM and Random Forest classifiers. Implemented in Python, deployed on Google Cloud. Extensively documented and available on GitHub."

Epileptic Seizure Detection
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to detect epileptic seizures. The dataset is analyzed using Python and scikit-learn. Two classifiers, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest, are trained and evaluated. The best model is deployed on Google Cloud. For detailed documentation and implementation, please refer to the provided code and documentation.

Project Structure
data/: Contains the dataset used for training and testing.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and model training.
models/: Saved trained models.
src/: Source code for the project.
train.py: Script for training the models.
predict.py: Script for making predictions using the trained models.
requirements.txt: List of required Python packages.
Usage
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/epileptic-seizure-detection.git
Install the required packages:
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Navigate to the src/ directory and run the training script to train the models:
bash
Copy code
cd src/
python train.py
Once the models are trained, you can use the prediction script to make predictions:
Copy code
python predict.py
Results
SVM Model Accuracy: 58.68%
Random Forest Model Accuracy: 94.03%
